# zlibVB
A simple  class to manage gzip streams. [archival]

This is an old project of mine, that I created back in 2007.<br/>
Imported into GitHub for archival puposes only.<br/>

<h2>Introduction</h2><p>Some time ago I was&nbsp;woking on a project and&nbsp;needed to decompress a <a href="http://www.gzip.org/">GZIP</a>&nbsp;stream, searching on the Internet I found several commercial libraries to do the job, but&nbsp;very few&nbsp;for the .NET platform and the ones I've found too expensive for my poor budget.</p><p>Once again I rolled up my sleeve and coded my own.</p><p>I got the original zlib from Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler and made my port to VB.NET. The first version of this small library was written in .NET 1.1, this version is just a&nbsp;rewrite to the .NET 2.0.</p><h2>Limitations</h2><p>Currently the zlib.NET only decompress GZIP files and streams compressed using the deflate algorithm.</p>
